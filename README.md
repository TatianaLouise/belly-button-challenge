# belly-button-challenge

In this project I built an interactive dashboard to explore the Belly Button Biodiversity dataset from https://robdunnlab.com/projects/belly-button-biodiversity/ - which catalogs the microbes that colonize human navels.

The dataset reveals that a small handful of microbial species (also called operational taxonomic units, or OTUs, in the study) were present in more than 70% of people, while the rest were relatively rare.

The dashboard includes: 
- A horizontal bar chart with a dropdown menu to display the top 10 OTUs found in that individual.
- A bubble chart that displays each sample.
- A display the sample metadata, i.e., an individual's demographic information.
- All of these visuals change as the value of the drop down menu is changed.
